In each exercise folder you find a folder for iris and iris-time.
In each of these folders run `npm install` to install all dependencies from npm into node_modules.
Make sure that the respective .env files contain your tokens and credentials.
In chapter 5 there is also a ecosystem.config.js file for iris and iris time.
Please make sure that the GitHub repo and server IP defined there matches your configuration.
